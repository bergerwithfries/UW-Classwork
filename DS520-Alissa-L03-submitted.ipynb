We have already investigated an example of a discrete process when we examined the outcome of dice throws. Each dice lands with a certain side up and the sum of the two numbers is the total score. \n",

    "The reason in (2) that we restrict the number of girl's names to 7 is so that we can compare the answer we get in (2) to the answer we get in (1). With this assumption, the two questions are very similar: 1 out of every 7 girls is born on a Thursday, and 1 out of every 7 girls is named Leila. The difference of course is that you can have two or more daughters born on a Thursday, but you can only name one of your daughters Leila. So this subtle distinction should play out in your solution. Note that you do not need to write code for this assignment. The solution can be worked out by hand."
